## Current State — What's Live ✅

App is **healthy** at `https://app.agentplayground.net`

### Platform (all deployed)
- Teams, Agents, Skills, Chat (streaming, 25-iteration tool loop, 30 tools)
- 2nd Brain: vault, MCP endpoint, graph, semantic search, brain chunks + HNSW
- Plans system: create → council review → approve → dispatch → execute
- LLM Provider adapter system (`lib/providers/`)
- Admin panel (`/admin`): analytics, API monitor, credit management
- Playground Teams Hub (`/playground`): team chat, widget grid, live data
- Coordinator mode: full COORDINATOR_INTRO prompt, delegation wired, plans wired
- SSE activity strip: live agent task notifications in chat
- `request_human_input` tool: agents pause mid-task for user decisions
- Project status dashboard (`/projects`): workstream panels, task counts
- Telegram: bidirectional DMs → coordinator, group notifications, settings UI
- PWA: manifest, icons, installable
- Design System v3: charcoal `#1a1a1a`, rust logo `#D4715A`, neutral palette

### Last Session (Session 17 — 2026-05-27)
- Documentation restructure: slim CLAUDE.md, new PLAN.md + PROTOCOLS.md + architecture.md (updated)
- `generate_session_report` tool (Brain upload from coordinator chat)
- Research auto-archive: `web_search` + `web_browse` → Brain automatically (P1 protocol)
- Task result auto-archive: `delegate_to_team` completion → Brain (P2 protocol)
- 4-step onboarding wizard: account → mission → team selection → data/LLM preferences
- `lib/seed-personal-teams.ts`: CV Advisory, Education, Financial Planner, Job Search, Fitness teams
- `POST /api/admin/index-docs`: indexes all docs into Brain; button in `/admin/system`
- 11 system protocols defined in `docs/PROTOCOLS.md`

---

## Next Session Priorities

See `docs/PLAN.md` for full detail. Short version:

1. **LLM Provider Settings UI** — `lib/providers/` adapter exists, no UI to manage keys or switch models per team. Build under `/settings`.
2. **Admin Monitoring Panel** — system health/usage: DB size, task volumes, SSE connections, error logs.
3. **Empty States** — Plans, Teams, Brain, Schedule all show empty divs when no data.
4. **Personal Agent Teams** (from current branch `feature/sensorguard-demo`) — CV Advisory, Education, Financial Planner, Job Search, Fitness teams + personal coordinator flows.

## Deploy Info

**Before ANY deploy:** read `docs/DEPLOY-PROTOCOL.md`.

Key rules:
- `scp` files → restart dashboard container. Never `git pull` on server.
- Slug names must match at same URL level (e.g. all `app/api/playground/teams/[id]/...` use `[id]`)
- Deleting directories requires `--no-cache` rebuild
- No pending schema changes at this time

```bash
# Standard deploy
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <file> root@95.217.163.247:/root/opt/vps/<path>
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@95.217.163.247 \
  "cd /root/opt/vps && docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build dashboard"
```

## Architecture Quick Reference

| Thing | Where |
|---|---|
| VPS IP | 95.217.163.247 |
| App path on VPS | `/root/opt/vps/` |
| Chat API | `app/api/chat/route.ts` |
| Chat tools | `lib/chat-tools.ts` (30 tools) |
| Agent runner (plan tasks) | `lib/agents/runner.ts` |
| Agent runner (delegated) | `lib/agents/delegated.ts` |
| Plan dispatcher | `lib/planner/dispatch.ts` |
| Brain ingest | `lib/brain/ingest.ts` |
| SSE stream | `GET /api/notify/stream` |
| Coordinator system prompt | `app/api/chat/route.ts` → `COORDINATOR_INTRO` |
| Design tokens | `app/globals.css` |
| Wallet addresses | `app/(app)/billing/page.tsx` → `WALLETS` |
| MCP endpoint | `app/api/mcp/route.ts` |

### Coordinator Flow
```
User → Coordinator (25 tool iterations)
  → delegate_to_team(teamId, title, desc)   ← single task, immediate
  → create_plan(goal) → run_plan(planId)    ← multi-team, parallel
  → get_task_result(taskId) × N → synthesize
```

### Not Built Yet
- Telegram env vars on VPS (`TELEGRAM_GROUP_CHAT_ID`, `TELEGRAM_OWNER_CHAT_ID`) — add to `.env.local` + restart
- LLM Provider Settings UI
- Admin Monitoring Panel
- Stripe payment automation
- Empty states (Plans, Teams, Brain, Schedule)
- Live blockchain integration (Crypto Wallet scaffold only)
